=head1 SYNOPSIS

...


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module checks some (basic) HTTP key figures:

  * HTTP / HTTPS for domain or www domain active; status OK?
  * HTTP redirects to HTTPS?
  * redirections
  * simple HTTPS Certificate Verification (via LWP with help from Mozilla::CA)
  
  
For simplification of the results, this check first tries to use http://www.domain.tld/ 
and only if this does gives an result only http://domain.tld/

So we don't have to count two results per domain, only one.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 http_active, https_active, https_all_verified, https_host_verified, https_cert_verified, https_cert_ok_host_not

Checks, if there is something on port 80/443 ...

Fails when Status is 500 and there is a "Client-Warning" header with "Internal response"

   * https_active is true, if there is HTTPS, certificate verify failed, but there is https.
   * https_all_verified is only true, if certificate verification is OK and host matches.
   * https_host_verified is true, if the SSL host matches, but cert is not checked
   * https_cert_verified is true, if there is a valid certificate (Mozilla::CA), hostname not checked
   * https_cert_ok_host_not is true, if there is a valid certificate, but hostname does NOT match
